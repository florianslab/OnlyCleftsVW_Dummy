<p>Five friends are playing a game: one is the gamemaster and the other four are the players.<br />
	In this game, each player belongs to a "House," which is determined by their card.<br />
	The gamemaster secretly elects one house (clubs, spades, diamonds or hearts)<br />
	as the Chosen one, and decides how many players (1 or 2) will join the Chosen House.<br />
	Then the gamemaster accordingly picks four cards and randomly deals<br />
	one of them to each player. Finally, the cards are revealed and<br />
	the gamemaster announces who will join the Chosen House.</p>

	<p>We extracted some comments from the gamemaster's announcements.<br />
		Your task will be to identify which player the gamemaster's comment is about.<br />
		Let's start with an illustration.</p>
